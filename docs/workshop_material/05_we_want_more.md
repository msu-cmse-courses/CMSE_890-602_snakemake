# 05 - We want more!

- Before going full ham creating your own Snakemake workflow, it's a good idea to see if someone has already made what you were thinking of creating! Have a look at the workflows available in the [Snakemake workflow catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/). Also see all the [results that were returned](https://github.com/search?q=rna+pipeline+snakemake) by searching "rna pipeline snakemake" in [github](https://github.com/). If it doesn't do exactly what you want, you can [fork it](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and adapt the workflow to your use

- Snakemake provides [incredible documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and there is an insane amount more you can do with Snakemake beyond what was covered here

- Snakemake also provides a [great tutorial](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html) (and a [short tutorial](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/short.html) for those pressed for time)

- Here is a fully established pipeline being used in production use that extends on the workflow we created in this workshop: [https://github.com/ESR-NZ/human_genomics_pipeline](https://github.com/ESR-NZ/human_genomics_pipeline)
