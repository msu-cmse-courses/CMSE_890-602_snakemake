This is a 'final basic demo workflow' that should have been created by following this Snakemake workshop up to [section 03 - create a basic workflow](https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/CMSE_890-602_snakemake/workshop_material/03_create_a_basic_workflow/). It includes all the files that comprise the **workflow**:

- `./workflow/Snakefile`

And the DAG's, filegraphs and rulegraphs we created during this workshop section:

- `./workflow/dag_*.png`
- `./workflow/rulegraph_1.png`
- `./workflow/filegraph_1.png`
