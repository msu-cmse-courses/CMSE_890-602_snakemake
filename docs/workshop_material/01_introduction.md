# 01 - Introduction

## This workshop


!!! note

    This workshop has been adapted for use in CMSE 890-602 Reproducible Computational Workflows. It was previously designed by Leah Kemp and NeSI and can be found here https://github.com/nesi/snakemake_workshop


This workshop is designed with someone who had some familiarity with the command line. However, I've tried to make it as accessible as possible to anyone who wants to learn Snakemake.

Throughout this workshop, I'll be indicating the code to remove and the code to insert (relative to the previous step) with the following:

```diff
- Remove this line of code
+ Add this line of code
```

*However, the actual `+` and `-` symbols should not be included in your own code*

At each section of the workshop you can find a drop down box under "Current snakefile:" that will contain the main Snakefile that comprises the pipeline as a plain text file to copy and paste from if you need to catch up.
